#### Notes:
This repo was inspired by the alexdevero's boilerplate ([electron-react-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/alexdevero/electron-react-webpack-boilerplate)) but I wanted create my own and minimal implementation just for fun and learning of course! 

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). ⚛️
